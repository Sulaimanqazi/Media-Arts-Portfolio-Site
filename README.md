# [Media Arts Portfolio Site](https://sulaimanqazi.github.io/Media-Arts-Portfolio-Site/M/)
### My first website ever created. Showcasing all my work done in Grade 10 Media Arts (ASM201) for a summative project. I recieved a grade of 100% on this project.

The purpose of this website was to showcase my artwork done in class as well as provide reflections on the class itself.  
With this website I used many cool CSS and JavaScript animations to make it look more visually appealing.

To create this program, I first prototyped the website's design using Figma, and implemented it in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

Many pages of my website contained a scrolling animation page influenced by Apple's website. 
This was made by using a javascript program which loop through individual images stored on Microsoft Azure as the user scrolls.
Many of these animations incorporated renders I designed in blender.
Unfortunately, my Microsoft Azure trial has expired therefore these animations **do not load anymore**.


I also implemented a cool CSS animation. In this, if you move your cursor on top of an image, it slides to the right and reveals text behind it!


Overall, this project taught me key fundamentals of website design, which I would use in further projects.
