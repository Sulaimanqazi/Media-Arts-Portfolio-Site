  <h2>Who are you? What three adjective best describes you? </h2>
  <p>
  <h3>Three adjectives I would use to describe myself would be Hard-working, Motivated, and Thorough. I would call myself hard working because I make sure to do my school work no matter what. Many times I procrastinate and end up with projects due in a short span, but I’ll still get it done no matter what. I’d also call myself motivated because I have school as my first priority, I have big dreams to get a high paying job and I work towards this goal by working hard in school and doing extracurriculars. A few months ago I personally made a decision to stop playing video games as much and now I’m trying to avoid apps like instagram and tik-tok to focus on more important stuff.  </h3>

  <h2>What are your hobbies and personal interests?</h2>
  <p>
  <h3>A lot of my hobbies and personal interests revolve around computers. It's one of the reasons why I took this course. Some stuff I enjoy include coding, 3d modeling, listening to music, and cooking. My favourite food to cook are steaks, it’s really hard to make a good steak but once you make it, it’s really good. I also bake foods like cookies and cakes. Music is a key part of my daily routine, I had over 40 000 minutes spent last year listening to music. Whenever I get the free time, I like to learn coding, it’s a useful skill and can be fun.</h3>

  <h2>How do you hope to be remembered by your peers and teachers at
  Richardson after you graduate?</h2>
  <p>
  <h3>I hope to be remembered by my peers and teachers as a person who was friendly, and hard-working while being a supportive and dependable friend.  Since the beginning of school, I’ve been trying to get to know many kids my age as they’re the ones that might be in my classes for the next four years. I’ve also tried to support many of my friends by helping them out with their studies if they needed help.

  <h2>What are your greatest dreams and fears?</h2>
  <p>
  <h3>My greatest dream is to become an engineer when I’m older. I want to explore fields such as computer engineering or computer science. I want to work in places such as California like my brother, who is a mechanical engineer.  My biggest fear is probably not achieving my dream. I have a lot of pressure from my family to perform well. All of my relatives have achieved high grades entering high demand courses, so I feel like I have to live up to these high expectations.

  <h2>What is one of the biggest challenges you have overcome this year? How
    did you overcome it and how has this helped you to grow and view
    things from a different perspective?</h2>
    <p></p>
    <h3>One challenge I had this year was building this website. I originally planned on building this website using google sites, but then I realized google sites doesn’t have tools needed for it to fully envision my dream for this website. I then moved on to a program called framer, and even that didn't have the tools needed for me to make this. So eventually, with 2 weeks left to submit this, I started over and moved to completely doing the website in code. Without any prehand experience for these languages except for a 1 hour lesson in our school's computer science club, I tried it and it worked perfectly. What I learned from this is to never be scared of trying new things. I was thinking about using code back in October but I was too scared, thinking it would be very hard. However now I was able to do it, even within a short timeframe. As the quote says “Pleasure in the job puts perfection in the work” which is what helped me gather the willpower to get this done to the best of my ability.
